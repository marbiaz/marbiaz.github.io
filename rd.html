<p>To support my research activity, I designed and developed several prototypes and tool sets.
<ul>
<li>Analysis of structural properties of Git repositories (GitWorks).</li>
<li>A decentralized P2P service for user preferences elicitation (WUW).</li>
<li>A P2P gossip-based framework for decentralized heuristics (P2POEM).</li>
</ul>

<H3><i>GitWorks</i> : Empirical analysis of Git-based software repositories</H3>
    <p><!-- <p class="empty-bottom"> --> I developed a java tool set that can mine and analyze the structural properties of git repositories.
	The final goal would be to assess correlations between the repository topology and good/bad development
	practices which affect the code evolution.<br>

<H3><i>WUW</i> : P2P algorithms for user preferences elicitation</H3>
	<p>I designed and developed a decentralized java P2P service that enables users to define personal preferences to be used to modify the distribution overlay topology of file sharing P2P applications.<br>

<H3><i>P2POEM</i> : P2P evolutionary function optimization algorithms</H3>
	<p>I designed and implemented gossip-based decentralized variants of several nature-inspired heuristics, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, or Differential Evolution.<br>
