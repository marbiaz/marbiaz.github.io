<p>I am a post-doc at INRIA - Rennes, France. I work on two research tasks:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Empirical analysis of opensource software repositories. The purpose is to understand nontrivial emergent patterns that characterize
successful projects. The analysis is meant to deepen the comprehension of the dynamics that undergo software design and development processes, focusing
on different scales.</li>
  <li>Evolutionary algorithms for software diversification. I am collaborating at the design and the development of a simulation environment to
test novel evolutionary techniques aimed at increasing software diversity, with the purpose of improving robustness and resilience of complex
software architectures. This task is performed within the <a href="http://diversify-project.eu" target="_blank">Diversify EU FET project</a>.</li>
</ul>

      <p>My main interests are:</p>

	 <ul>

	  <li>Empirical analysis of Git-based software repositories (see  <a href="http://github.com/marbiaz/GitWorks" target="_blank">GitWorks</a>
	  on Github).</li>
	<li>P2P algorithms for user preferences elicitation (see <a href="http://github.com/marbiaz/WhatUsersWant" target="_blank">WUW</a>
	on Github).</li>
	  <li>Design and the implementation of P2P evolutionary function optimization algorithms (see <a href="http://p2poem.sf.net" target="_blank">P2Poem</a>

	  on Sourceforge).</li>

	<li>Distributed decentralized processing in a peer-to-peer fashion.</li>

	<li>Epidemic protocols for overlay maintenance to support distributed algorithms in large-scale P2P networks.</li>

	</ul>
